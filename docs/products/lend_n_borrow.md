# Lend & Borrow

Welcome to the revolutionary world of DeFi lending and borrowing with Emmet Finance.

## What is Lending & Borrowing?

In traditional finance, lending and borrowing involve two parties: the lender who provides the funds and the borrower who receives them, with an agreement to pay back at a later date, typically with interest. The concept is the same in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, but with a trustless and permissionless twist.

## How Does Lending & Borrowing Work on Emmet Finance?

At Emmet Finance, we aim to democratize access to financial services by providing a platform where anyone, anywhere can lend or borrow crypto assets without needing a traditional intermediary. Here's a quick overview:

1. **Lending**: Users can deposit their cryptocurrency tokens into a pool. In return, they receive interest on their deposit, which accrues over time.

2. **Borrowing**: Users can take out a loan by depositing collateral into the protocol. The collateral must be greater in value than the borrowed amount to account for the volatility of the crypto market.

## Why Choose Emmet Finance for Lending & Borrowing?

1. **Open Access**: Our platform is open and accessible to everyone, regardless of location or financial status. All you need is an internet connection and a digital wallet.

2. **Competitive Rates**: We offer some of the best interest rates for both lenders and borrowers in the DeFi market.

3. **Security**: Our smart contracts undergo rigorous testing and auditing to ensure maximum security for your assets.

4. **Flexible Terms**: There's no fixed term for lending or borrowing, meaning you can withdraw or repay at any time, providing it complies with the rules of the protocol.

5. **Earn Passive Income**: Lenders can earn passive income on their crypto assets, an opportunity not typically available in the traditional financial system.
