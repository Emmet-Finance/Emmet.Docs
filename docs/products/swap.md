## Swap

Welcome to the future of cryptocurrency exchanges, welcome to Emmet Finance's swapping platform.

## What is Swapping?

In the realm of cryptocurrencies, swapping refers to the process of exchanging one cryptocurrency token for another. It's a fundamental operation in the DeFi ecosystem, enabling seamless transactions across a wide array of tokens.

## How Does Swapping Work on Emmet Finance?

Our platform leverages automated market-making (AMM) algorithms to facilitate the swapping process. Here's a simple rundown of how it works:

1. **Select Tokens**: Choose the pair of tokens you wish to swap. For instance, you may want to swap Bitcoin (BTC) for Ethereum (ETH).

2. **Input Amount**: Determine the amount of the source token you wish to exchange.

3. **Confirm Swap**: Review the estimated amount of the destination token you'll receive, along with any fees involved. If everything looks good, confirm the swap.

4. **Transaction Execution**: Emmet Financeâ€™s AMM system will find the best possible swap rate for your transaction. Once the swap is completed, the new token will be added to your wallet.
