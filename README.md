## Abstract

This white-paper details the platform's features, architecture, governance, security measures, and road-map, outlining how Emmet.Finance aims to reshape the DeFi landscape.

## Mission

Our mission at Emmet.Finance is to provide a secure, transparent, user-friendly and cost-effective solution to the liquidity fragmentation on isolated blockchain protocols.

## Value Proposition

Emmet.Finance is a pioneering decentralized one-window solution that leverages multi-chain and multi-protocol technology multiplied by the major DEX aggregation.

## Architectural Principles

1. **Zero-Trust protocol**: No trust assumptions are made on behalf of the protocol users, liquidity providers, cross-chain relayers, or token price oracles.
2. **Security above all**: Utilization of the Web-2 and Web-3 security best practices to protect the investors, liquidity providers and user's funds.
3. **Modular Architecture**: The project consists of upgradable modules.
4. **Decentralized ecosystem**: A DAO governance model, ensuring all the major strategic decisions are made in an inclusive democratic way.
5. **User-friendliness**: Intuitive front-end interfaces, illustrated user documentation, eagerly available support channels.
6. **Developer-friendliness**: Easy integration via an SDK, developer documentation, eagerly available developer support.
